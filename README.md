# Fingerprint timetracking with a raspberry-pi

## Background
Currently the European Union force to all the companies to keep a record of all employees working times. The application is compliant with the EU requirements.

## Description
This is a python application running on a raspberry-pi with a fingerprint reader. It records all employees clockin and clock out in timesheets that are automatically uploaded to a [kimai2] application on the cloud. The project is originally designed to be running in restaurants keeping records of employees timesheets.

### Hardware
---

- Raspberry-pi 4. It has not been tested with other raspberry pies.
- Real Time Clock. The raspberry-pi has no hardware clock.
- Fingerprint reader. It should be compatible with ZhianTec (ZFM-20, ZFM-60, ZFM-70 and ZFM-100). Visit the driver website https://github.com/bastianraschke/pyfingerprint for more information.
- Touch screen. For this project I used the official raspberry-pi 7 inches touch screen.
- A custom hardcase. You can use a 3d printer for it.

**Fingerprint reader and raspberry pi connection**

I am using `DollaTek Blau Licht Optischer Fingerabdruckleser Sensormodul f√ºr Arduino Mega2560 UNO R3` (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07PRMXXXN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

**Fingerprint cable configuration (it might be different for your fingerprint device)**

The red cable is 3.3V

The white cable is TxD

The yellow cable is RxD

The black cable is GND


### Installation
---

**Set up your raspberry-pi**

Install the latest raspberian OS into your raspberry-pi.

After login in your raspberry-pi allow ssh access to your raspberry-pi, e.g:
```
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

**Set up the harwarce clock on your raspberry-pi**

Set up the hardware clock in your raspberry OS, a couple of howtoes: [howto1](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-rtc/), [howto2](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/17209332-adding-a-real-time-clock-to-your-raspberry-pi)

As summary of the above tutorial you will have the following steps:

1) Bind physically the hardware clock

2) Enable the I2C module running on your raspberry-pi: ```sudo raspi-config```

**On your local development machine**

To automate the set up of your raspberry-pi with ansible, you will have to copy your ssh-key into the raspberry-pi. You can use the below command on , where the USERNAME value is your username at the raspberry-pi and the IP-ADDRES value is the ip addres of the raspberry-pi.

`ssh-copy-id <USERNAME>@<IP-ADDRESS>`

Install ansible in the local machine, e.g.:

`sudo apt install ansible`
or
`brew install ansible`


Edit the file ansible/inventory.yml and set the ip value of your raspberry and your local source code path:

```yaml
raspberry_pies:
  hosts:
    192.168.1.113 # set your raspberry ip here
  vars:
    src_project: /home/paconte/devel/timetracker # set your src path here
```

Edit the file src/ctes.py for your needs, but at least set the following variables:

```python
#### Raspbian file constants ####
## The path where the project is installed in your raspberry-pi
PROD_PATH = '/home/pi/timetracker'
## The path to your local developement repository
DEVEL_PATH = '/Users/paconte/dev/rusties/timetracker'
```

Edit the file src/ctes.py to set up your customers values:

```python
# Customers custom variables
COMPANY_NAME = "Restaurante Pizzeria la Palette"
COMPANY_SHORT_NAME = "palette"
COMPANY_TZ = "Europe/Madrid"
COMPANY_CURRENCY = "EUR"
COMPANY_COUNTRY = "ES"
COMPANY_LANGUAGE = "es"
COMPANY_COLOR = "#d2d6de"
COMPANY_LEADER_PREFIX = "admin_"
COMPANY_EMAIL_EXTENSION = ".com"
COMPANY_LEADER_NAME = COMPANY_LEADER_PREFIX + COMPANY_SHORT_NAME
COMPANY_LEADER_EMAIL = COMPANY_LEADER_NAME + "@" + COMPANY_SHORT_NAME + COMPANY_EMAIL_EXTENSION
COMPANY_LEADER_PASSWORD = ""
COMPANY_USER_PASSWORD = ""
COMPANY_USER_EMAIL = "@" + COMPANY_SHORT_NAME + COMPANY_EMAIL_EXTENSION
```

Install Kimai2 on an external machine. (Currently only has been tested in a external server and not locally on the raspberry-pi).

Edit the file src/ctes.py and configure your kimai2 variables:
```python
#kimai2 variables
KIMAI2_URL = "http://192.168.1.107/api/" # this is an example
KIMAI2_USER = ""
KIMAI2_PASSWORD = ""
```

Run ansible to set up your raspberry-pi. Go inside your repository path and run:

```
cd ansible/raspberry && ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```



### Troubleshooting
---

The syncronization with the kimai2 server is logger by default into: `/home/pi/timetracker/logs/k2sync.log`

The app logs are in `/var/log/syslog`. This need an improvement and the log file should be in `/home/pi/timetracker/logs` as well.



### Custom case
---

The idea is to print it with a 3D printer using one of this designs as a base:
